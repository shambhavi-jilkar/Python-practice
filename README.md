# Assignment 1
Q1. Given an integer n perform the following conditional actions:
•	If  n is odd, print Weird
•	If  n is even and in the inclusive range of  2 to 5 , print Not Weird
•	If  n is even and in the inclusive range of  6 to 20 , print Weird
•	If  n is even and greater than  20 , print Not Weird

Q2. Read an integer N . For all non-negative integers i <  N , print i^2. 
Eg. 5
Sample Output 0
0
1
4
9
16

Q3. Accept the year, and you have to write a function to check if the year is leap or not.

Q4. Accept a list (list = []) elements. You can perform the following commands:
1.insert i e: Insert integer  at position .
2.print: Print the list.
3.remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer .
4.append e: Insert integer  at the end of the list.
5.sort: Sort the list.
6.pop: Pop the last element from the list.
7.reverse: Reverse the list.

Q5. Ms. Gabriel Williams is a botany professor at District College. One day, she asked her student Mickey to compute the average of all the plants with distinct heights in her greenhouse.
Input Format :
The first line contains the integer, , the total number of plants.
The second line contains the  space separated heights of the plants.
Output Format :
Output the average height value on a single line.

Q6. You are given a string. Split the string on a " " (space) delimiter and join using a - hyphen.
Input Format :
The first line contains a string consisting of space separated words.
Output Format :
Print the formatted string as explained above.
Sample Input 
this is a string   
Sample Output
this-is-a-string

Q7. Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message that tells them the year they will turn 100 years old.

Q8. Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.

Q9. Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you don’t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)
