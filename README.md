# Assignment 1

Q1. Given an integer n perform the following conditional actions:

•	If  n is odd, print Weird

•	If  n is even and in the inclusive range of  2 to 5 , print Not Weird

•	If  n is even and in the inclusive range of  6 to 20 , print Weird

•	If  n is even and greater than  20 , print Not Weird


Q2. Read an integer N . For all non-negative integers i <  N , print i^2. 

Eg. 5

Sample Output 0

0

1

4

9

16


Q3. Accept the year, and you have to write a function to check if the year is leap or not.

Q4. Accept a list (list = []) elements. You can perform the following commands:

1.insert i e: Insert integer  at position.

2.print: Print the list.

3.remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer .

4.append e: Insert integer  at the end of the list.

5.sort: Sort the list.

6.pop: Pop the last element from the list.

7.reverse: Reverse the list.


Q5. Ms. Gabriel Williams is a botany professor at District College. One day, she asked her student Mickey to compute the average of all the plants with distinct heights in her greenhouse.

Input Format :

The first line contains the integer, the total number of plants.

The second line contains the  space separated heights of the plants.

Output Format :

Output the average height value on a single line.


Q6. You are given a string. Split the string on a " " (space) delimiter and join using a - hyphen.

Input Format :

The first line contains a string consisting of space separated words.

Output Format :

Print the formatted string as explained above.

Sample Input 

this is a string   

Sample Output

this-is-a-string


Q7. Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. 
Print out a message that tells them the year they will turn 100 years old.


Q8. Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). 
If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.


Q9. Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. 
(If you don’t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)
